- current bosh implementation in v3.x uses curl multi/async
  which causes problems when running in cgi environment
  either fix it or port v2.x bosh curl (blocking) 
  implementation to get it going

- some more work on exception handling

- move http pkt parsing logic to http_server from http_request
  this should do a better fix for multi-part form parsing,
  websocket upgrades in future etc etc

- add pk regexp support in http dispatcher

- create separate repo for /core, /xmpp + /xep, /http

- add composer and pear install support <<-- already done by a fork, merge it

- more tests, full test suits, ci and built reports on github
